I'm continuing the project of https://github.com/BAWV12/Concorde

About Flight Dynamics. I put back the original. I changed values, but i don't know them to be honest. So the original are good.

I'm making 3D Flight Engineer Panel.

For a good installation, you must place the folder like that: "(Your acirafts folder)/Concorde/(All the files and folders of the plane)
